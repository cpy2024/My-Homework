# My-Homework
This section contains a collection of homework that Iâ€™ve typeset using LaTeX since spring 2023 during my studies at Beijing Normal University, School of Mathematical Sciences. 

Most of them were written in Chinese.  Each assignment includes both a PDF version and the corresponding TeX source code for a deeper understanding of the typesetting details.  

Please review the solutions with discretion, as I cannot guarantee absolute correctness. Feel free to contact me if you have any specific questions about any of these assignments or if youâ€™d like to discuss them further. ðŸ“šðŸŒŸ
